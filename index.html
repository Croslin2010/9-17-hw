Visual Representation of Data
</h1>
  
 <h3>
   Good Example
  </h3>
  <img src="incidents-monthly-lg.jpg"/>
  <p>
    This first chart is a good example due to its simplicity and clarity.  It holds a title so viewers understand what the chart represents as well as headings for different parts of the chart so readers can understand every section.

  <h3>
    
    Bad Example
  </h3>
  <img src="Serendipity_Search01.jpg"/>
  <p>
    This next example is a very poor data visualization.  It holds no title so viewers vave no context to what it shows as well as no subheadings for viewers to even attempt to piece its meaning together.  It's nothing but color and a few cryptic words corresponding with the color.
